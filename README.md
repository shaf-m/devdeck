## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **⌘ Powerful Macros** | Execute shell scripts, open URLs, paste text snippets, or simulate complex keystrokes with a single tap. Automate your repetitive tasks instantly. |
| **📋 Clipboard History** | Never lose a copied snippet again. Access your clipboard history directly from the radial menu and paste past items with ease. |
| **✨ Context Aware** | DevDeck adapts to the app you're using. Create specific profiles for Xcode, VS Code, Final Cut Pro, or any other app, and DevDeck switches automatically. |
| **📝 Snippet Manager** | Save and organize your frequently used code blocks. Insert them instantly into any editor without breaking your flow. |
| **🤝 Shareable Profiles** | Export your custom macro profiles and share them with your team or the community, enhancing collaboration and standardization. |
| **🔓 Open Source** | Transparent and community-driven. Inspect the code, contribute features, and build with us. |

## ⚡️ How It Works

### 1. Install & Launch
Download the app, move to Applications, and grant accessibility permissions.

### 2. Configure
Create profiles for your favorite apps. Add all your macros, snippets, and shortcuts.

### 3. Flow
Trigger the menu anywhere. Hold down the trigger key (default: `~`) or tap the icon in the menu bar to open the menu. Move your mouse to a node to execute a macro instantly.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation
